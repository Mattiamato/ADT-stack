Task C): ADT Stack

The aim of this task is to get an overview of the ADT Stack. You were in the holidays and your assistant made a mess with your mails. You have three trays, each for its own specific purpose. So all the letters have a purpose and therefore have to be in the
corresponding right tray.

1) printTrays()

In the file main:cpp you have the skeleton of a method named printTrays() which should
print an simple overview of the trays with the letters in it on the standard output.

2) cleanUp - Algorithm

We provide you a function skeleton named cleanUp() which should clean up the mess
your assistant made. After this method has been called, every letter should be in the
right tray.

Hint: Use a temporary tray to order all the letters.
